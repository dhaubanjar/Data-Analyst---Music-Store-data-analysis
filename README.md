## SQL Portfolio Project: Music Store Data Analysis

### Overview

This SQL portfolio project utilizes a Music Store dataset to showcase a range of basic to intermediate SQL skills. The project involves solving several questions related to the dataset, with a primary focus on SQL operations such as joins and window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `OVER()`. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in handling real-world data scenarios using SQL.

### Dataset Description

The Music Store dataset comprises several tables that represent various aspects of a music store, including:

- **Customers**: Information about customers.
- **Employee**: Information about employees.
- **Invoice**: Details of purchases made by customers.
- **Invoice_line**: Details of invoice_line.
- **Track**: Information about music tracks available in the store.
- **Playlist_Track**: Information about music playlists tracks.
- **Playlist**: Information about music playlists.
- **Album**: Information about music albums.
- **Artist**: Information about music artists.
- **Genre**: Information about music genres.
- **Media_Type**: Information about the types of media the tracks are available in.

### Skills Demonstrated

1. **Basic SQL Queries**:
   - Selecting data from multiple tables.
   - Filtering data using `WHERE` clauses.
   - Aggregating data using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.).

2. **Joins**:
   - Performing `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` operations to combine data from multiple tables.
   - Understanding the relationships between different tables in the dataset.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - Using `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign unique sequential numbers to rows within a partition.
   - Utilizing `OVER()` clauses to define partitions and ordering within window functions.

4. **Advanced SQL Techniques**:
   - Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.
   - Using window functions for running totals, ranking, and other analytical calculations.


### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of SQL skills through practical questions and solutions based on the Music Store dataset. It highlights the ability to perform data analysis and derive insights using SQL, with a focus on joins and window functions.
